Inference- For dates 11 and 12,Here I could say the measured low was still higher than the predicted load by looking at the plot.As these were initial days of winterstorm, there was no problem with outages and people's measured energy usage was not much higher than energy usage in later days

For dates 13, 14
Inference- If you could see the plots are more blue than previous ones, which says that the measured load was higher than predicted load compared to 11 and 12.
I could say 13 and 14 were days winter storm started to get severe and hence more measured energy compared to the days 13 and 14

Inference- For date 15, the measured energy should be higher than 13 and 14, so it should be more dark blue, but if you see the plot, you can see some whites and lights blue. This infers that some servicepoints experienced half outages or light outages, but not severe

Inference- For dates 16 and 17, the few parts of orange and red tells us that there was outages at certain service points because the measured load was less than predicted load

Inference- Dates 18 and 19 is where the things were going back normal and winterstorm effect has too been reduced, 18 and 19 shows a graduate shifting from red,orange color to blue in few servicepoints, which infers than outages in few service points were being restored
